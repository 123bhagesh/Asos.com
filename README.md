<h1 align="center">Clone of asos.com</h1>
This project is a clone of "https://www.asos.com/", which is a health, grooming, and beauty Products website.
This website has end-to-end functionalities from Signup/login and searching the Products and adding products and removing the products from the cart page. I have incorporated payment and pay through the card. I have added many sorting techniques to sort the products on their respective pages based on their ratings, and prices, alphabetically. We had used import and export for the navbar and footer.
